# Road-to-DataScience-ML-Step2---AccuracyCaluclation
In my previous repository, titled "Road-to-DataScience-ML-Step2--AccuracyCalculation," I discussed the initial steps for cleaning and tidying datasets. These are the foundational steps anyone should follow when working with any dataset. After ensuring the data is clean and structured, the next goal is to evaluate the accuracy of our models by applying Machine Learning algorithms. In this repository, I will delve into these algorithms.

## The Algorithms I used are:
     1. Naive Bayes Algorithm.
     2. K- Nearest Neighbors Algorithm.
     3. Support Vector Machine.
     
### Follow the Below Steps To Get a complete outlook on Accuracy Calculation:
     Step 1: Take a Dataset and Apply these Algorithms(I provided the codes separately), and calculate the accuracy for each of them.
     Step 2: Now we shall do a crazy thing by deliberately adding missing values into the dataset and run the above algorithms to see the accuracy change, obviously the accuracy decreases.
     Step3: Now take the missing values dataset and fill the missing values using Mean, Median, Mode, K-nearest Neighbors, Multivariate imputations, and Deep Learning methods (Which I discussed in my previous Repo(Road-to-DataScience-ML-Step1--DataPreprocessing.
     Step 4: For the above generated dataset once again apply accuracy algorithms and check which filling method produces more accuracy.
